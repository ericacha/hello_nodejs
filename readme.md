In fact, Node.js's underlying JavaScript engine is V8, which is the same engine used in Google Chrome. The major difference between Node and a browser like Chrome is that the browser provides the runtime environment in the browser, whereas Node provides it on the command line. And they have slightly different capabilities, with the browser providing tools like the DOM, and Node providing tools like file system access.
